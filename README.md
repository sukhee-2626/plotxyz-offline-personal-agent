> **PlotXYZ.ai Agents** — specialized intelligence. One connected workspace.

## 1. Project identity and purpose

**Offline Personal** is an original, independently runnable PlotXYZ.ai agent MVP. Provides a chat interface with deterministic local behaviors (safe arithmetic, extractive summaries, note-to-plan) and optional inference through a configured OpenAI-compatible or Ollama endpoint.

The project is a functional reference implementation, not a claim that PlotXYZ.ai owns or endorses any third-party technology. It runs without a paid API key: the deterministic implementation is the default path, and optional model providers are configured explicitly.

## 2. Problem statement and intended users

Teams often need a focused, inspectable tool rather than another general chatbot. This agent packages one clear workflow with structured inputs, deterministic checks, and an exportable result.

**Intended users:** People who need a privacy-preserving assistant on a laptop or an air-gapped workstation.

## 3. Features

- **Deterministic offline fallback**
- **Optional local-model inference**
- **Safe arithmetic and extractive summaries**

- **Structured results:** metrics, findings, tables, charts, graphs, patches, or generated documents as appropriate.
- **Task history:** local SQLite persistence for completed runs.
- **Provider status:** the dashboard reports whether an optional model adapter is configured.
- **Accessible states:** loading, success, validation error, and offline-API states are explicit.

## 4. Screenshots

## 5. Architecture

  U[User] --> W[React + TypeScript dashboard]
  W -->|POST /api/run| A[FastAPI service]

  V --> L[Offline Personal deterministic logic]
  L --> R[Structured result]
  A --> H[(SQLite task history)]
  W -->|GET /api/meta and /api/history| A
```

The frontend is a Vite/React single-page dashboard. The backend validates the request, applies a 200,000-character payload limit, runs the agent-specific logic, stores a local history record, and returns a structured response. The logic layer is original Python and does not execute supplied code or shell commands.

## 6. Technology stack

| Layer | Technology |
| :-- | :-- |
| Frontend | React 18, TypeScript, Vite 5, Lucide icons, custom CSS design system |
| Backend | Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic 2 |
| Persistence | SQLite (local task history) |
| Tests | Pytest, FastAPI TestClient |
| CI | GitHub Actions (backend tests + frontend production build) |

## 8. Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or newer
- Node.js 20 or newer and npm
- Git
- No paid API key is required

## 9. Installation and startup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sukhee-2626/plotxyz-offline-personal-agent.git
cd plotxyz-offline-personal-agent
```

### Backend

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --app-dir backend
```

The API is available at `http://localhost:8000`; interactive docs are at `/docs`.

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. The frontend defaults to `http://localhost:8000` for the API. Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to point elsewhere.

### Production deployment

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run build
# Serve frontend/dist with any static host or reverse proxy.

cd ../backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` at build time to the public API URL, and set `CORS_ORIGINS` to the deployed frontend origin. Persist `backend/data/` if task history matters. The app is otherwise stateless and does not require a paid API key.

## 10. Environment configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and export the values in your shell (the backend does not auto-load `.env`).

| Variable | Purpose | Required |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Frontend API base URL | No (defaults to `http://localhost:8000`) |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | OpenAI-compatible API base | No |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Provider key (never commit it) | No |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | Model name for the optional adapter | No |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | Local Ollama-compatible base URL | No |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | Local model name | No |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated allowed origins | No |
| `MAX_PAYLOAD_CHARS` | Server-side payload limit | No (default `200000`) |

The deterministic path is always available. When no provider is configured, the UI shows **Deterministic mode** and the API reports the provider status without exposing secrets.

## 11. API example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"payload": {"message": "Summarize my project notes.", "context": "The launch is scheduled for June 3. The team agreed to cut scope. Marketing will prepare the announcement.", "use_provider": false}}'
```

Sample payload:

```json
{
  "message": "Summarize my project notes.",
  "context": "The launch is scheduled for June 3. The team agreed to cut scope. Marketing will prepare the announcement.",
  "use_provider": false
}
```

The response contains `summary`, `result` (structured metrics, findings, tables, charts, or documents), `warnings`, `agent`, and `task_id`. See [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md) for the full contract.

## 12. Testing

```bash
cd backend
python -m pytest -q

cd ../frontend
npm run build
```

The backend suite covers the sample workflow, empty-input rejection, health/meta endpoints, the run endpoint, history persistence, and HTTP 422 validation. CI runs both jobs on every push and pull request.

## 13. Security and privacy considerations

- No endpoint exposes arbitrary shell execution or unrestricted filesystem access.
- The agent never executes supplied code, downloads files, or writes to user-selected paths.
- Inputs are size-limited; errors are structured and do not leak secrets.
- Secrets are read from environment variables and are never returned by the API.
- Optional model calls go only to explicitly configured environment endpoints; user-supplied URLs are not fetched.
- SQLite history is local to the backend and can be cleared from the dashboard.
- See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for reporting guidance.

## 14. Limitations

- The fallback is rule-based and cannot answer open-domain questions.
- Model inference requires a separately configured endpoint.

- The deterministic logic is intentionally scoped; optional AI inference may improve flexibility but is not required or guaranteed.
- Results are decision support, not professional advice. Review outputs before acting on them.

## 15. Roadmap

- [ ] Expand deterministic offline fallback with configurable policies.
- [ ] Add deployment manifests, structured audit logs, and load tests.
- [ ] Add more export formats and team-oriented workspaces.
